Find Magic Numbers for [Magic Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards) in swift

Haven't taken the time to actually debug this, just kinda eyeballed something that would spit out 128 numbers for me to work on my other project, I'll come back later and fix it. Unless it works of course, then all bets are off.
